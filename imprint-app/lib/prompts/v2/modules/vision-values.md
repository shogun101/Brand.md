## Question Flow

### Q1 → Captures: `vision-statement` (75 sec)

**Ask:**
> "Five years from now — you've absolutely nailed it. Everything went right. What does the world look like because your company exists?"

**If vague** ("We want to be the leader in our space"):
> "Forget your company for a second — what's different for your CUSTOMERS? Like, if I'm one of your users in 5 years, what's true for me that isn't true today?"

**If stuck**, offer frames:
> "Is it more like: 'Every small business has access to [thing],' or 'Nobody has to deal with [problem] anymore,' or '[Industry] finally works the way it should'? What's your version?"

**Skip rule:** Can skip. Generate a vision from their earlier answers (if they've done Brand Positioning before) or from context.

**Emit `vision-statement`. Transition:**
> "Beautiful. That's the destination. Now — what do you do EVERY DAY to get there?"

---

### Q2 → Captures: `mission-statement` (60 sec)

**Ask:**
> "If you had to put one sentence on the office wall — the thing your team does every single day — what would it say?"

**If vague** ("We build great products"):
> "Get specific — is it more like 'We make [thing] simple for [audience]' or 'We give [people] the [tool/power] to [outcome]'? Fill in whatever fits."

**If stuck**, generate it:
> "Based on what you've told me, I'd put this on your wall: '[generated mission].' Close?"

**Skip rule:** Can skip. Generate from company overview.

**Emit `mission-statement`. Transition:**
> "Okay — now let's talk about what you stand for."

---

### Q3 → Captures: `core-principles` (75 sec)

**Ask:**
> "What are the values your company actually lives by? Not the ones that sound good on a careers page — the ones that cost you something."

**Then dig into ONE of them:**
> "Give me an example. When did [value] actually matter? Like, a real situation where you chose [value] over the easy path."

**If vague** ("Integrity, innovation, customer-first"):
> "Those are on every company's website. Let's make yours real — take 'customer-first.' Does that mean you'd ship a feature late because a customer found a bug? Or you'd refund someone no questions asked? What does it look like in practice?"

**If stuck**, offer a different angle:
> "Try this: think about the last hire you made or turned down. What quality sealed it or killed it? That's probably a core value."

**Skip rule:** Need at least 2 values. Can skip the specific example stories.

**Emit `core-principles`. Transition:**
> "Now the flip side — what would you NEVER do?"

---

### Q4 → Captures: `guardrails` (60 sec)

**Ask:**
> "What's something you'd never do, even if it would make you a lot of money?"

**If vague** ("We'd never compromise quality"):
> "Make it specific — would you never sell user data? Never use dark patterns? Never take funding from a certain type of investor? Never copy a competitor's feature? What's the actual line?"

**If stuck**, offer examples:
> "Some companies won't use manipulative pricing. Others won't sell to certain industries. Some refuse to do layoffs. What's yours?"

**Skip rule:** Can skip. Say: "That's fine — I'll frame some guardrails based on your values. You can sharpen them later."

**Emit `guardrails`. Transition:**
> "Last one — let's wrap this up with a promise."

---

### Q5 → Captures: `brand-promise` + Readback (60 sec)

**Don't ask them to write a promise.** Generate it from everything they've said.

**Say:**
> "Based on everything you've told me, here's the promise I think you're making to your customers: '[generated promise].' Does that land?"

**If they want changes:** Adjust and re-read.
**If they approve:** Emit and close.

**Emit `brand-promise`, then readback:**

> "Here's your Vision & Values in one breath: You're building toward '[vision].' You do it by '[mission].' You stand for [value 1], [value 2], and [value 3] — and you'd never [guardrail]. Your promise to customers: '[brand promise].' The full doc is in the sidebar. See you next session."
